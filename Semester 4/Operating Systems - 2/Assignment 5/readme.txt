Input generation:
Use matrix_gen.py file to generate input file. Execute by using the following command, then give 'number of threads' and 'number of vertices' in console. For example:
py matrix_gen.py > input-params.txt
2 10

This generates an adjacency matrix with 10 vertices. A sample input-params.txt generated is:
2 10
 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

Keep "input-params.txt" file in the same folder as the following programs.

Compile the programs in the following manner:
	g++ SrcAssgn5-coarse-CS19B1004.cpp -o coarse -lpthread
	g++ SrcAssgn5-fine-CS19B1004.cpp -o fine -lpthread

Run the programs using:
  ./coarse
	./fine

The outputs generated by both files will be output-coarse.txt and output-fine.txt respectively
