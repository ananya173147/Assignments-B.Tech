### The assignment includes:
 1. Writing the HDL for the intended design
2. Writing the Test Bench
 3. Simulation the design and the test bench

#### Problem 1:
Design a system which receives 4-bit 8 data samples sequentially and output even sequenced data from the third data point onwards. Verify the design functionally by writing a test-bench at least for two sets of 4-bit 8 data samples. You need to simulate the entire design using the test bench.

#### Problem 2:
Design a system which receives 4-bit 8 data samples sequentially and output odd sequenced data from the fourth data point onwards. Verify the design functionally by writing a test-bench at least for two sets of 4-bit 8 data samples. You need to simulate the entire design using the test bench.

#### Problem 3:
Design a system which receives 16-bit data sequentially and output even and odd sequenced data from the fourth data point onwards. Verify the design functionally by writing a test-bench at least for two sets of 16-bit data. You need to simulate the entire design using the test bench.
